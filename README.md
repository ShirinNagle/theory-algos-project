Repo to calculate the SHA512 value of an input file


   A description of your repository and its contents pitched at a knowledgeable outsider.
   Compilation instructions stating how to compile, test, and run your program.
   
   ### An explanation of what the SHA512 algorithm is and why it is important.
   When a message of any length less than 2^64 bits (forSHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256) or less than 2^128 bits (for SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224and SHA-512/256) is
   input to a hash algorithm, the result is an output called a message digest. The message digests range in length from 160 to 512 bits, depending on the algorithm.
   Secure hash algorithms are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, or 
   in the generation of random numbers (bits).[1]
    
   ### Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?
        
   ### Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?
        
   ### How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
